I am once again going to be giving a blog a shot. This time I will be using a software called Jykell. Jykell is a blogging platform that relies on just plain text rather than a SQL database. It is a more techincial version of a system like wordpress. 

I am most interested in this because it will allow me to really 	just do what I want with the system with zero overhead. Absolute best part is I will be able to write my code within my favorite text and code editor <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text 3</a> and I will be able to push it to the github using git.

We shall see how this goes, but for now this is my new blog.
